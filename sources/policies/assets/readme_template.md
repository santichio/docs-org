  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) v20.10+ (with Docker Compose v2.0+ recommended)
- Access requirements (e.g., VPN, internal org credentials)
- Hardware specs (if applicable, e.g., 8GB RAM minimum)
- Git installed for cloning the repository
- **Org-Specific Tools**: [Internal Tool Name] (request access via [link](#)).

## Installation
Separate setup steps from running the project for clarity:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/org-name/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install  # or equivalent
   ```

## How to Run Locally
Provide step-by-step instructions to get the project running on a local machine. Be clear and concise. Example:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt, depending on the project
   ```
4. Configure environment variables (if applicable):
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
   - Add your API keys or other credentials
5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start  # or python main.py, etc.
   ```
6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the relevant URL).
