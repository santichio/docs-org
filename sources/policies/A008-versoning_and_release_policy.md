# Versioning & Release deploy policy

# Versioning

The defined versioning pattern to keep tracking is SemVer 2.0. 

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
3. PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

# Release

- Define what a release is.
- Need a document describe all changes.
- All releases gonna be dated in advance to not compromise company operation.
    - How long? A month before.
